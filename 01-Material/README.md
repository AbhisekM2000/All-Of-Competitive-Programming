## Some good and informative blogs :

Below is the encyclopedia of all that one needs to set up the schedule of cp and start away asap.


* [Awesome Competitive Programming by lnishan](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#sites-for-practice)

* [ACM-ICPC Preparation Repository by BedirT](https://github.com/BedirT/ACM-ICPC-Preparation)

* [Getting into Competitive Coding by hyp0cr1t3](https://github.com/the-hyp0cr1t3/CC)

## Books and Other Long Reading Materials :

* Check out [this](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#books-for-algorithms) section for a long list of books.

* I prefer to have [Competitive Programmers Handbook by Antti Laaksonen](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) and [Introduction To Algorithms by CLRS](https://web.iiit.ac.in/~pratik.kamble/storage/Algorithms/Cormen_Algorithms_3rd.pdf) as mandatory. 

> Note: The best time to read the topics in any book is either in the morning or in the evening to grasp everything.
