# CP Material

Many of the seniors as well good competitive coders advice to not waste any money on the courses which are designed for beginners. It is always easy to start cp on your own and be good at it. However you can choose to have a good certification on Data Structures and ALgorithms offered by [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/certification/data-structures-and-algorithms/about) or choose a course which aims at advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Books:

* Check out [this](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#books-for-algorithms) section for a long list of books.

* I prefer to have [Competitive Programmers Handbook by Antti Laaksonen](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) and [Introduction To Algorithms by CLRS](https://web.iiit.ac.in/~pratik.kamble/storage/Algorithms/Cormen_Algorithms_3rd.pdf) as mandatory. 

> Note: The best time to read the topics in any book is either in the morning or in the evening to grasp everything.

## Some good and informative blogs :

Below is the encyclopedia of all that one needs to set up the schedule of cp and start away asap.

* [ACM-ICPC Preparation Repository by BedirT](https://github.com/BedirT/ACM-ICPC-Preparation) : The curriculum and schedule one needs to follow to learn data structures and algorithms for ICPC.

* [Getting into Competitive Coding by hyp0cr1t3](https://github.com/the-hyp0cr1t3/CC) : This repo is best for starting cp. It contains everything you need to master cp from basic setup to data structures along with decent problemset. Make sure to check the tips and tricks section.
 
* [Awesome Competitive Programming by lnishan](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming) : The encyclopedia of cp. It contains in-depth analysis as well as topic wise practice problems. Probably more than one can ask for.

* [Competitive Coding Implementation by Ashishgup](https://github.com/Ashishgup1/Competitive-Coding) : Whenever you run into any problem, just check the implementation of Ashish Sir. His codes are easy to understand and beautifully formatted.

* [OEIS](https://oeis.org/) : who doesn't love integer sequences? Well everyone should.
