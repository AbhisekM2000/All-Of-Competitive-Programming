# All-Of-Competitive-Programming
This repo will contain all the competitive programming resources.

## The essentials that every competitive programmer should have:

1. CP environment on local machine. 

2. CP Books. 

3. Habit of reading blogs. 

4. Practice! Practice! Practice!

5. Should NOT have a complaining nature. 

This repo will keep on updating as new resources are found. 

Note : I don't claim any of the works as mine. I have just curated them at one place.
