# All-Of-Competitive-Programming

This repo will contain all the resources a beginner needs to start excelling in competitive programming.

## The essentials that every competitive programmer should have:

1. Set up CP environment on local machine. 

2. CP Books. 

3. Habit of reading blogs. 

4. Practice! Practice! Practice!

5. Should NOT have a complaining nature. 

#### The best technique to prepare for any major contest or for success is to make a proper schedule and follow it.

* Habit of reading blogs / books / texts in the morning.

* Implementing everything that you have read at the same time. 

* Elaborating the concepts on your own and thinking about the different ways any topic can be modified and then implementing the same.

* Extensive practice on problems at the night.

* Helping Others in understanding the concepts you have learnt: This might seem like a waste of time but it really helps in clearing the concepts and solving others doubts make your concept crystal clear.

* Having a Good Sleep.

This repo will keep on updating as new resources are found. 

Note : I don't claim any of the works as mine. I have just curated them at one place.
