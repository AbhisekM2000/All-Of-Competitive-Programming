#### The best technique to prepare for any major contest or for success is to make a proper schedule and follow it.

* Habit of reading blogs / books / texts in the morning.

* Implementing everything that you have read at the same time. 

* Elaborating the concepts on your own and thinking about the different ways any topic can be modified and then implementing the same.

* Extensive practice on problems at the night.

* Reading and understanding other users solution.

* Reading Editorials even if you have solved the problem.

* Helping Others in understanding the concepts you have learnt: This might seem like a waste of time but it really helps in clearing the concepts and solving others doubts make your concept crystal clear.

* Having a Good Sleep.

#### Tools for Competitive Programming

These are the following tools which may be of great use:

* [C List](https://clist.by/) : Similar to CP Tracker but contains as list.

This repo will keep on updating as new resources are found.
