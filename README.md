### The best technique to prepare for any major contest or for success is to make a proper schedule and follow it

* Habit of reading blogs / books / texts in the morning.

* Implementing everything that you have read at the same time. 

* Elaborating the concepts on your own and thinking about the different ways any topic can be modified and then implementing the same.

* Extensive practice on problems at the night.

* Reading and understanding other users solution.

* Reading Editorials even if you have solved the problem.

* Helping Others in understanding the concepts you have learnt: This might seem like a waste of time but it really helps in clearing the concepts and solving others doubts make your concept crystal clear.

* [C List](https://clist.by/) : Similar to CP Tracker but contains as list.

* [Codeforces Visualiser](https://cfviz.netlify.app/) : can track your progress on codeforces and can see the ratings of problems you re currently stressing on and your improvement. 

* [Kenkooo Atcoder](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder) : A visualisation tool for AtCoder.

* [StopStalk](https://www.stopstalk.com/) : The best and complete analyser. It will maintain

### Speed

Speed plays a very important role in perfoming well during the contests. 

For improving the speed, AtCoder is a great platform. Try attempting the problems and solving them in alloted time which is:

* 1-2 minute for A & B.
* Approx 5 minutes for C
* Approx 10 - 15 minutes for D & E.

This will greatly boost the confidence and enhance the logic building and typing speed, in general.
